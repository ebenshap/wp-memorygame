This is a plugin for wordpress

All that's required to use it is to create a page and put the following shortcode in it:
[Memory Game]

This plugin only works in a page!!!!!!!

Unfortunately the design of the game is dependent on the width of the overall website being atleast 900px wide. Also the game lookes best when it's centered and on a one page layout. But for the moment, those issues are not resolved. But with appearances aside, everything else works.
