This is a plugin for wordpress

All that's required to use it is to create a page, or a post, and put the following shortcode in it:
[Memory Game]

This plugin only works in a page, or a post.

Unfortunately the design of the game is dependent on the width of the overall website being atleast 900px wide. And the css isn't bullet proof, so the way things are styled may get a little overridden. The game looks best when it's centered and on a one page layout.
